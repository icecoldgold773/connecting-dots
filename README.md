# Connecting Dots 

This repository houses a 2. semester project created by a group of computer science students from Aalborg University. The project's main objective is to enhance the understanding of non-domain experts in supervised machine learning. To achieve this, the group has developed a website that visualizes feature maps, loss, and accuracy metrics from various pre-trained convolutional neural network models. The user can choose from a set of models trained on the MNIST dataset, and the metrics for the selected model will then be shown. Additionally, users can choose a random image from the MNIST test set or draw their own. This will then display the first layer of feature maps along the model's prediction. This enables the user to compare different models and evaluate their performances, facilitating a better understanding of the underlying concepts.
