\section{Machine learning in medicine}
\label{Machine_learning_medicine}
As mentioned earlier in \todo{Indsæt henvisning til relevant afsnit}, the medical sector, is one that could see massive upsides from the use of machine learning.
If a fully realiable machine learning system was made for use in medicin, it could mean incredible improvements in waiting time, getting a better prognosis, faster and more accurate diagnosis, better treatment and much more.\cite{rajkomar2019machine}
Unfortunately, this reality is still far away, but hospitals have started adopting and researching the use of machine learning systems as a supporting tool for use in medicin.\cite{Elhakim2021mammography}\cite{lalehzarian2021machine}

One of the reasons why machine learning is not being considered and used more widely in medicine, is the lack of visualization and explainablity of machine learning models.\cite{vellido2020importance}\cite{chatzimparmpas2020state}
As mentioned earlier in \todo{Indsæt henvisning til relevant afsnit}, this lack of visualization and explainablity leads to distrust of the machine learning system.\cite{yang2020visual}
This is a major issue with using machine learning in medicin, as a mistake can lead to severe complications or even death. Therefore building trust in machine learning is of upmost importance if it is to ever become a reality in medicine.\cite{vayena2018machine}
