\subsection{What is digital learning?}\label{ch:what_is_digital_learning}

Digital learning is the use of technology, such as computers, the internet etc. to give education and aid learning. It allows students to learn at their own pace, from any location, and at any time, making education more accessible and flexible. 
This approach to learning can be beneficial for people with different needs and requirements. Digital learning enables increased access to education and there are multiple factors that has to be taken into consideration, but the main ones can be summed down to these points\cite*{What_Is_Digital_Learning}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item   Pace:
	Digital learning offers a broader choice of instructional tools and materials than would be available in a traditional classroom. this can be any educational material that can be found on the internet.\cite*{What_Is_Digital_Learning}
  \item Locatition:
	  Digital learning allows students to access educational content from any location, as long as they have internet connection. This means that students do not need to attend a physical school if they cannot do so because of geographical boundaries or mobility issues. Digital learning also enables students to learn while being on the go.\cite*{What_Is_Digital_Learning}
  \item Flexibility. 
	Digital learning can be accessed anytime, anywhere. This allows students to work on their education around their own schedules, whether they are working, or pursuing other interests. Students can also choose to learn at their most productive times--early in the morning or late at night--which can be  beneficial for those who does not have time for traditional school.\cite*{What_Is_Digital_Learning}
\end{itemize}
However Digital learning is not only beneficial for students but can also benefit companies and organisations in giving new skills to their staff\cite*{Skills_Digital_Learning}

\subsubsection*{Digital Learning in work places}

The increasing use of technology in Industry 4.0 is expected to bring about a range of impacts, including reduced labor costs, greater flexibility, and shorter delivery times. It also promises to automate dangerous tasks, promote productivity growth, and lead to higher quality products.
Additionally, it is expected to result in safer surgeries, improved quality of life for the elderly and people with disabilities, and the creation of new products and services. However, these changes will also bring about new challenges in terms of employment and education, as well as changes in the way companies and organizations are structured.
A survey conducted on this topic indicates a low level of positive correlation between perceived challenges faced by organizations and opportunities for new disruptive business and new trends of skills.
It also shows a negative relationship between perceived challenges and organizational digital transformation. Overcoming these negative perceptions is necessary to adopt new trends in skill development and capitalize on new opportunities.\cite*{Skills_Digital_Learning}

\subsection{Visual learning and its properties}\label{ch:visual_learning_and_its_properties}
\subsection{Spatial intelligence and awareness}\label{ch:spatial_intelligence_and_awareness}
The capacity to imagine and visualize different objects and patterns is one of the 9 intelligences, some people prefer a hands on approach, need to ask questions in order to learn, others need to write things down and most of us can gain a quicker understanding through visual learning.\cite*{pracpsych2022}.


(Lohman 1996) states that spatial intelligence, or visuo-spatial ability, has been defined as "the ability to generate, retain, retrieve, and transform well-structured visual images”\cite[p97]{tapsfield1996}, with that definition in mind this section will describe the importance of spatial intelligence in regards to visual learning and spatial reasoning.

\subsection{The ability to visualize}\label{ch:the_ability_to_visualize}
We probably all have heard the saying "a picture is worth a thousand words", this saying was originally invented by and advertising executive (Fred R. Barnard)\cite*{phrases2022}, like in advertising the power of the retainability of the message is in focus.

%Menneskets evne og/ellers computers evne til at formidle visuelt 
%A geoscientist mentally manipulates the movement of tectonic plates to see the process of earth formation.
%A neurosurgeon visualizes different brain areas to predict the outcome of a surgery.
%A civil engineer imagines how various forces may affect the design of a system.
%Architects and engineers use material of various shapes and sizes to create stable structures.
%A designer uses visual spatial reasoning concept to enhance the user experience of his product.
%An artist creates stunning visual arts.
%A gymnast uses spatial awareness to perform a sequence of movements with the human body.

There are many benefits to visual representation, some of these benefits will be reviewed in the next section.
\subsection{Visual and text representation}\label{ch:visual_and_text_representation}
%Nemmere ved at repræsentere forskelle, medianer, yder punkter, statistikker, grafer osv. osv.
%Matematik -> geometri, patterns, arithmetic, number sense osv.

%What is digital learning? - Hvad består begrebet digital learning af og hvad er de primære elementer i det? 
    %Hvem bruger det og hvem gavner det? 
    %Hvilke værktøjer benytter man til den digitale proces?

  %Visual learning and its properties - Den digitale proces er visuelt repræsenteret
    %kræver mindre interaktion, der står en del om forskellen på e-learning og digital learning somewhere
    %fordele/ulemper ved visuel læring generelt (masser af keywords nedenfor), husk at skelne generelt og mennesket

%Keywords/sentences regarding digital learning: 
  %Pros -> Learn from anywhere, anytime, learn in your own pace, revisit materials and redo lectures, track progress, gamifiction, personalized learning, supports blended learning, collaborative learning.

  %Cons -> Limited teacher %& student interaction, risk of social isolation, cheating is more brutal to monitor, digitally challenged people has trouble, issues with quality, requires self-motivation and time management, practical component of learning suffers, limited to specific disciplines, lack of development of communication skills, prolonged screen exposure.
