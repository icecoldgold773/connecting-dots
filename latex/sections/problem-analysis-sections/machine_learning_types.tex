% Introduction

\subsection{Supervised Learning}\label{sec:supervised-learning}
Supervised Learning is a widely used Machine Learning technique where a machine learning model trained 
on a labeled dataset can be used to predict the label of unlabeled data. The model adjusts its weights 
according to the accuracy of the model, allowing it to learn over time. The accuracy gets calculated through
a loss function which measures how far the predicted value is from the expected output. \cite{ml_supervised_learning}

% Different models
Supervised learning models can be split into two categories, regression and classification. Regression is used when
the output is continuous, while classification is used when the output is a discrete value. An example of a problem
where regression is used is predicting the price of a house based on parameters such as the size of the house, the number of rooms and the location.
An example of a classification problem is predicting if a received email is spam. \cite{ml_reg_vs_class}
