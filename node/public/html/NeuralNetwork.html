  <h1>What are Neural Networks?</h1>
  <p>The neural network (NN) is a type of machine learning technique inspired by the biological neural network - <b>The brains network.</b> The biological neural network consists of a network of neurons. Every neuron obtain electric signals from other neurons and then they treat this information and sends it to other neurons. Its the same principle in the artificial neural network, as it has artificial neurons.</p><br> 

  <p>Another crucial concept to neural network is <b>weights</b> and <b>biases</b>, which are parameters in the neural network that simplify data identification</p><br>

  <p><b>Weight</b> refer to a connection between two neurons</p><br>

  <p><b>Bias</b> is added to a neuron to help influence the end product</p><br>

  <p><b>The artificial neural network</b> works by taking one or more inputs, applying different functions and weights and then turning this into one or more outputs. </p>

  <img class="figure" src="../img/logo/NNstruture.png" />

<p>The artificial neural network consists of one <b>input layer</b> one or more <b>hidden layers</b> and lastly one <b>output layer</b>. This type of neural network is also called a <b>feed forward neural network</b> because the connection between the neurons doesn't create a cycle. But there exists various different architectures, such as feedforward, recurrent, and convolutional networks, to model various types of data and tasks, such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making. The models at the front page are <b>convulutional neural network models</b>, <a class="link" href="./index.html">front page</a></p><br>

<div class="top_bar">
	<h2>Convulutional neural network</h2> 
	<p> CNN is a type of feed-forward NN that classifies images by detecting different features in an image. A CNN is generally made up of three types of
	layers: <b>Convolutional layers</b>, <b>pooling layers</b>, and <b>fully connected layers</b>. Depending on the complexity of the classification problem, there can be multiple convolutional layers and pooling layers, but there is only one fully connected layer.</p>

	<img class="figure" src="../img/logo/CNN.png"/>
	
	<p>In <b>the convolution layer</b> patterns in the image are detected. The convolution layer consists of several filters (also referred to as kernels). Each filter is a matrix of weights that is applied by sliding the filter over the image and then taking the weighted sum of the pixel. The value of each weight in a filter is typically initialized randomly, and then adjusted during the training phase (backpropagation) to detect the important features to correctly classify the image, <a class="link" href="./Backpropagation.html">read about backpropagation here</a></p><br>

	<p>After the convolution layer, the output is passed through an activation function which is typically the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) function, <a class="link" href="./ActivationFunction.html">read about activation functions here</a></p><br>

	<p><b>Same padding</b> is the act of adding a border of pixels around the image with a value of zero. This is done to ensure that the output of the convolution layer has the same dimensions as the input image.</p><br>

	<p><b>The pooling layer</b> is used to reduce the size of the image, and hereby reduce the number of parameters in the network. This helps reduce the computational complexity of the network, without losing too much information.</p><br>

	<p><b>The fully connected layer</b> is the last in CNNs. The fully connected layer is a standard NN layer and is the final step in the classification process.</p><br>
